What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git create a hidden folder with some file. when the programmer launch git status can see that is the initial commit and the file in the same folder. this file aren't add to repository of commint and warning that yoy must add it for see the difference with git


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an area that can collocate a file that programmer want change. in this area say to git record the diff between version of the file that has choose. this area are different between working area becausa don't do change the content of file but only the status.
repository is different because contain all the canghe that are made and can't canghe a status of file.
git diff compare working directory with staging area
git diff commit1 commit2 compare 2 commit in repository area
git diff --staged compare staging area with commit1 in repository (the most recent)


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
i'm sure to use staging area per logical change because i dont commit before tha change is done

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
i can see all the version of a project and i can create backup branches and new features banche without brake a master branche.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
the people can work in more features in same moment and than merge in master branch. 
because the diagram explain in a simple way that we have do.
git log --graph --oneline to see all log in a short view. a commit take only a line.
