How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an area that can collocate a file that programmer want change. in this area say to git record the diff between version of the file that has choose. this area are different between working area becausa don't do change the content of file but only the status.
repository is different because contain all the canghe that are made and can't canghe a status of file.
