How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

i can see the difference betwen two file with a special character in the begin of line.
i can in a simple way return in a previous version of file when the bug not exits


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i could see when a bug born and i can delete it in a few time


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

i can decide when i create a commit. i can create my standard and i know when usually create commit but i must remember create commit though i'm hurry 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because I can create a state of the project. when I add a new feature do I know what I have modified files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

1) git log --stat --> for view commit id, number of change row and a comment of them
2)git diff        --> i can see the change row


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

it can return in a previous version and restore that until the programmer sees the bug starts. it can use 
git checkout idcommit to return a previous version


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

i'll use git for write my script for work and home (for example smart home or create new reception or certificate script).
